# p78_nrf24
An single-file nrf24l01 library built on top of libopencm3 for STM32F4.

## How to use:
Assuming using the libopencm3-template:
1. Clone into my-common-code
2. Include header file in project code
3. Add ```p78_nrf/nrf24l01.c``` in my-project/Makefile under ```CFILES```
The steps should be similar for different project directory configurations.
